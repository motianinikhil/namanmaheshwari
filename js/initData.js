I designed a robust state machine which saves their values in a RAM during test and restores them after test-completion, overcoming the challenge of asynchronous functioning of RAMs. Alongside this, I worked on the Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) for critical IPs under the scope of self-test for automotive safety. I implemented a novel technique of Low-Power Scan (LP-Scan) invented by my team, which led to 43% reduction in scan-shift power. The LP-Scan architecture required modification of the ATPG tool-generated patterns and the major challenge was to calculate its fault-free Multiple Input Signature Register (MISR) signature. I created an automated infrastructure to generate fault-free MISR signatures for custom patterns and further developed it to support the generation of ROM-Images containing patterns and MISR signatures for self-test critical IPs. To address the debug and diagnosis limitations of the MISR-based scan-compression patterns, the flow was enhanced to support the per-cycle and per-pattern MISR signature generation. This flow resulted in debug-time savings of millions of cycles. </p><p>This internship provided me with invaluable practical experience in cutting-edge technology, where I was able to solve a potential high-impact problem, saving significant test-cost for TI.</p><p> I presented this work in TIITC-2016</p>"
